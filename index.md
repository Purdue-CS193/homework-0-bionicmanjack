## Jack Garrison's first CS193 Homework

### Things I like about CS193

- I have quite a few friends in the class, including three of my five suitemates.
- The teachers seemed very chill during the first lecture.
- It is only one credit and thus, in theory, should be a more relaxed class.
- I know nothing about Github, so I am excited to learn more about it through the class.
- There will probably be more things as the semester continues!
